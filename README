This document is a work of fiction and philosophy, serving as a functional exemplar of collaborative writing.
This is and has always been the best way of producing all work (much as Wikipedia was the new way of producing an encyclopaedia).

It is free in every useful sense: free of cost, free for everyone, free of licensing or intellectual property restrictions.
It is open in the sense that everyone is allowed to publicly access and edit or contribute to it.
It is publicly recorded in as much as the revisioning system which present it makes edits and contributions transparent and verifiable; everyone's contributions are accountably recorded as theirs.
It is a continuous project everyone can participate in however they wish. Using Git, everyone can take part in the creative process of this document's evolution however and from whatever point in the evolution of the structure they wish. 

If you understand the struggle for free work, you too may realise such efforts currently represent grasps at the intangible. Regardless, it invites and enjoys participation. 
Howeer, if you produce high-quality work and want it to be understood and enjoyed as much as possible for as long as possible, it is best to use the most advanced publication methods available. Publishing work this way invites greater longevity because if your work is more widely read, understood, and lovingly reproduced--you can reasonably expect it will have greater more lasting impact.

As an artistic data structure it is almost alive when compared to non-free, limited access, private works.
You can participate and view work created this way by letting the version system  help visualise the work's overall structure and growth.

This document attempts to prove free, collaborative writing a more efficient use of technology for writing.
Writing to espouse the ideal of freedom, and as a creative outlet, falls muchly into he science-fiction/fantasy genre.

Free, highly collaborative documents which are interesting, inspiring, and fun? By making the story within engaging, self-consistent, and robust enough to be useful to everyone? That sounds so complicated you�d need to read it as deeply as you�d read a science textbook to understand! People are scared and/or bored by things they don�t understand; move on--this will not get me laid! Documents which purport to fulfill any function usually are either too deep to readily comprehend, or too informationally dense for more than some parts to be useful to everyone, especially when information is presented in outdated, un-searchable formats like traditional paper publications shelved inaccessibly in libraries. The Internet, initially designed as a packet-switching/sharing network to help researchers share data sets (it really was), now has capabilities far in excess of its initial design because of the onward march of technological progress. Using the technology of the Internet to present new free, open, public work represents a significant leap forward and must be embraced, as from the very beginning of the creative process it gets work published in an inclusive collaborative, participatory way. 
Sadly, earning a living from using the new methods provided at the limits of our technology needs further discovery and work.

You can help. Please begin by reading, editing, and contributing in any way you wish. Have fun!
